splithalf R package
===================

This package contains several functions to calculate the split-half reliability of response time based cognitive tasks.

Currently the package contains three functions;

splithalf() calculates the split-half reliability within the conditions specified. DPsplithalf() calculates the split-half reliability for the attention bias index from dot-probe data, in each condition specified. DPsplithalf.all() calculates the split-half reliability for the attention bias index from dot-probe data, and the split-half reliabilities of congruent and incongruent trials, in each condition specified.

Functions will be added as they are developed, including accuracy rate indices, task-switching paradigms. The central code of the splithalf functions can be modified as needed to fit with most tasks.

Examples for each function are provided in the function descriptions, and two extended examples are presented in the vignette.
